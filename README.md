# traveling-travelers-travel
CSE 2102 Project 

The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with Java, object-oriented programming in general, and both command line and graphical interfaces. This program functions as a an Integrated Traveler System. This means that it provides a way for Travler and Travel Agents to view, edit, create, and delete traveler profiles. It has a lot of potential to be expanded and improved, but for now that is the extent of its functionality. 

It contains five files, one of which acts as a database and two of which are the two types of interfaces. The remaining two classes function as the means to create these traveler profiles. 

This project was assigned and completed in two parts. The first part was responsible for creating the functionality of the base three classes (TravProf.java, MedCond.java, TravProfDB.java) as well as creating the CLI (TravProfInterface.java). The second part of this project was solely for us to familiarize ourselves with the Java Swing library and create a GUI (SwingGUI.java).
